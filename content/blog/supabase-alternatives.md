Supabase has gained significant popularity as an open-source Firebase alternative built on PostgreSQL, with accelerated adoption in the AI era as developers seek robust Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solutions for their AI-powered applications. However, depending on your specific needs, there are several other platforms that may better suit your project requirements. This article explores the top alternatives to Supabase in 2025.

## Neon - Closest match

[Neon](https://neon.tech) is arguably the closest alternative to Supabase, offering serverless PostgreSQL with branching capabilities. Like Supabase, Neon is built on Postgres, but provides several distinct advantages:

- **Serverless architecture**: Truly auto-scaling PostgreSQL that scales to zero when not in use
- **Database branching**: Create instant database clones for development, testing, and preview environments

Where Neon differs from Supabase is its focus on being a pure database platform rather than an all-in-one backend solution. While Supabase offers authentication, storage, and edge functions bundled together, Neon concentrates on providing the best PostgreSQL experience possible.

For teams already comfortable with PostgreSQL who don't need all the extras of Supabase, Neon provides a more streamlined, cost-effective solution with cutting-edge features like database branching that Supabase doesn't offer.

## Hasura - If you like GraphQL

[Hasura](https://hasura.io) is a neck-to-neck competitor to Supabase as a BaaS, but with a crucial difference: its GraphQL-first approach. Unlike Supabase, Hasura doesn't bundle database services, allowing it to work with virtually any database including Supabase's own Postgres, Neon, and others.

What makes Hasura particularly compelling is the "Hasura + Neon" combination for developers who prefer GraphQL over REST. This pairing gives you Neon's serverless PostgreSQL capabilities with Hasura's powerful GraphQL engine, offering a modern stack that's both developer-friendly and highly scalable.

For teams already invested in GraphQL or looking to build complex data-intensive applications, Hasura provides a more specialized alternative to Supabase while still allowing you to bring your own database of choice.

## AppSheet - Low barrier

[AppSheet](https://www.google.com/appsheet/) (acquired by Google) represents a radically different approach with a much lower barrier to entry than Supabase, focusing on the powerful combination of AppScript (for handling logic) and Google Sheets (for storing data):

- **True no-code platform**: Build complete applications without writing code
- **Google Sheets as database**: Use familiar spreadsheets instead of managing a dedicated database
- **AppScript integration**: Add custom logic and automation with JavaScript when needed
- **Zero infrastructure management**: No database servers to provision, secure or maintain
- **Mobile and web apps**: Deploy across platforms with native mobile apps automatically generated

Compared to Supabase, AppSheet offers significantly lower maintenance overhead and a gentler learning curve. There's no need to manage a dedicated database, handle migrations, or write complex SQL queries - your data lives in Google Sheets, which most business users already understand.

This approach is particularly valuable for small to medium-sized businesses, non-technical teams, and rapid prototyping scenarios where getting started quickly and minimizing operational overhead matters more than database performance or complex data relationships.

## Firebase - Faded

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), the platform Supabase was originally created to provide an alternative to, remains a viable option with particular strengths:

- **NoSQL document database**: Great for projects that benefit from schema flexibility
- **Comprehensive toolkit**: Authentication, storage, analytics, messaging in one package
- **Strong mobile support**: Deep integration with iOS and Android development
- **Google Cloud ecosystem**: Works seamlessly with other Google Cloud services
- **Mature SDKs**: Well-documented client libraries for major platforms

Firebase's NoSQL approach can be advantageous for certain use cases where schema flexibility is important. While PostgreSQL's JSON support has become quite competitive, there are still scenarios where Firebase's document-oriented model might be preferable.

There are some trade-offs to consider, however. Firebase tends toward vendor lock-in due to its proprietary APIs, and its development pace appears slower compared to Supabase's rapid iteration. Pricing can also become less predictable as applications scale.

For teams already invested in the Google Cloud ecosystem or those who specifically prefer a NoSQL approach, Firebase remains a solid choice. For others seeking more flexibility and an open-source foundation, Supabase offers a compelling alternative with its PostgreSQL backend.

## Parse - Emeritus

[Parse](https://parseplatform.org) deserves mention primarily for its historical significance as the precursor that inspired the entire backend-as-a-service space. Founded in 2011, Parse pioneered many concepts that we now take for granted in modern BaaS platforms.

After being acquired by Facebook in 2013 and later open-sourced in 2016 when Facebook discontinued the hosted service, Parse has lived on as a community-maintained project. It represents an important chapter in the evolution of backend services.

While Parse laid the groundwork for platforms like Supabase, we don't recommend using it for new projects in 2025. The technology has been surpassed by more modern alternatives.

## Conclusion

While we've listed several Supabase alternatives, it's worth emphasizing that **Supabase itself should still be the first option you consider** when starting a new project in 2025. Here's why:

- It has achieved the strongest community adoption among modern BaaS platforms
- It has become the de-facto stack included in most SaaS templates and starter kits
- It's natively integrated into AI coding platforms like [bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
- Its combination of PostgreSQL, robust auth, and storage hits the sweet spot for most applications

If Supabase doesn't quite fit your specific needs, then the alternatives we've discussed each offer unique advantages:

- **Neon**: An excellent choice for serverless PostgreSQL with branching capabilities that perfectly complement the emerging agentic development workflow
- **Hasura**: Ideal for GraphQL enthusiasts who want to bring their own database
- **AppSheet**: Perfect for non-technical teams seeking a no-code solution
- **Firebase**: Suitable for those deeply invested in the Google ecosystem and wanting a NoSQL solution

As we move deeper into the era of AI-assisted coding and agentic development, platforms like Supabase, Neon, Hasura that embrace open standards and provide flexible, programmable interfaces will continue to gain momentum. The future belongs to services that can seamlessly integrate with AI coding assistants and autonomous agents while keeping developers in control of their data and infrastructure.
